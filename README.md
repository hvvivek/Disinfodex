# Vivek to do (10/31/20)

### Page structure
- [ ] About page bug: doesn’t seem to load
- [ ] Contains Screenshots breaks after clicking missing “About” page (on the Database page)

### Cards
- [ ] Deconflict duplicate content under Platform records (the Record based view is better) — keep the screenshots fixed but scroll the text record part
	- [ ] Images: max-height: 300px; internal screenshots are 100% (bg can be like #c0c0c0)
	- [ ] Keep left side of Network info the same
	- [ ] Replace right side Description with pill link to Disclosure (opens to the individual disclosure pop-up)
	- [ ] Put Description under Network etc.

### Dropdown selectors
- [ ] Open only one dropdown at a time
- [ ] Multiselect dropdown: change from toggle to right side check mark
- [ ] Have x on selected items to remove dropdown

### Card view
- [ ] Database needs a loading state for content
- [ ] Clean up pagination CSS: make “Cards” view look more like Table view

### Table view
- [x] Table: default to 25 rows
- [ ] Make cards sortable
- [ ] Start with reverse chronological view for cards and the table (newest on top)
- [x] Change all links to pills (Network)
